    <h1>More About Me</h1>
    <p>This page says a bit more about me.</p>
    
  <h2>My life recently</h2>
    <p>Since this is my final quarter at UW, I'm trying to make the most of the time that I have left. </p>

  <p>Here are <strong>some</strong> of the things I've been doing:
   <ul>
    <li>Spending time with friends</li>
    <li>Attending eScience institute lectures on data science</li>
    <li>Studying for entry-level certs</li>
    <li>Attending in climbing competitions</li>
   </ul>
  </p> 

  <h3>Sports</h3>
  <p>I used to play waterpolo and soccer in highschool, and I even played waterpolo for the UW club team for my freshman and sophomore years!</p>
